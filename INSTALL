               INSTALL for GAPDoc package (preliminary!)


You *need* GAP-4-dev (not 4.2) because of recent changes in lib/help.g 

---------------------------
Install: just copy package into directory GAP4ROOT/pkg/gapdoc and put the line 

gapdoc 

into GAP4ROOT/pkg/ALLPKG
---------------------------

(Re)constructing the GAPDoc documentation:

    You need a sufficiently good TeX installation including pdflatex,
    bibtex, makeindex and several LaTeX packages. For example
    teTeX-1.0 or (Linux-)packages based on it are ok.

    Then: inside GAP4ROOT/pkg/gapdoc do

     gap4dev makedoc.g
    
(and maybe restart gap4dev to have the documentation available inside GAP)

If this doesn't work unpack: GAP4ROOT/pkg/gapdoc/docu.tar.gz 

There are two books in the directories `doc' and `example' (and a short
example from chapter one of `doc/manual....'.

---------------------------

Suggestions for viewing the documentation.

- For text browsing inside GAP terminal window you may set (in .gaprc?)

PAGER := "less";
PAGER_OPTIONS := ["-f", "-r", "-a", "-i", "-M", "-j2"];
# and you may try: 
ANSI_COLORS:=true;
# remove the line or change it to `ANSI_COLORS:=false;' if your terminal 
# doesn't support ANSI color sequences, or if you don't like it.

- For pdf-viewing with `xpdf' try

SetHelpViewer("xpdf");

or something like

SetHelpViewer("xpdf", "xdvi", "screen", "netscape");
