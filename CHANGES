0.99999 -> 0.999999

- Improved the documentation which markup is allowed in attribute values
  (recursively substituted entities). Improved the code to handle all
  special XML or LaTeX characters in attribute values, they must be escaped
  by the converter programs for HTML and LaTeX output.
  
- Changed further details for handling special characters; e.g. in LaTeX we
  now try to use always the nicer characters for \{}~^ from the \texttt
  font.

0.9999 -> 0.99999

- Now MathSciNet often gives two numbers as MRNUMBER in BibTeX references.
  For links in HTML text we use now only the first 9 characters (MRxxxxxxx).
  (Thanks to Alan Cain.)

- HTML conversion: 
  - changed XHTML DOCTYPE to official URI of definition.
  - added 'lang="en"' and 'xml:lang="en"' attributes to the <html ... > tag.
  - fixed a problem with forward references. (Thanks to Marco Costantini.)

- PDF conversion:
  - using author and title in document for PDF meta-information.
  - attribute values with underscores were not correctly escaped, this is
    fixed and an example is added to the documentation, see
    ?GAPDoc Example: MyOperation (for bla)
  - now handling XML meta-characters '<>&' in attribute values.
  
- The XML Parser now prints the position of the start tag when it finds 
  a non-fitting end tag.

- Some minor documentation improvements.
