           Some reminders for the authors

- further improve NormalizedArgList:  "[KG,] x" is better than "[KG][,]x"

- add the utility to access the MathSciNet database for BibTeX records.
  (mk.g in doc/ref)

- should the bibliography and the index appear in the table of contents?
  (if yes, in all output versions) 
  [use: \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{References}   ?]

- allow the distribution of different output documents (html, text, pdf,...)
  into different directories (needs to change the handler for GAPDoc books).

- think about combining index entries, when they point to the same section
  (e.g., a function with several types of arguments, where the entries are
  only distinguished by the 'Label' attribute and are explained in the same
  man section).
