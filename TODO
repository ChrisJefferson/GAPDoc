- maybe add links to "the" example in the reference section of doc?
  (not so sure, if this is necessary).

- check, if everywhere the <A>, <Arg> elements inside <M>, <Math>, <Display>
  are handled correctly.

- should the bibliography and the index appear in the table of contents?
  (if yes, in all output versions)
