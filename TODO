           Some reminders for the authors

- maybe add links to "the" example in the reference section of doc?
  (not so sure, if this is necessary).

- check, if everywhere the <A>, <Arg> elements inside <M>, <Math>, <Display>
  are handled correctly.

- should the bibliography and the index appear in the table of contents?
  (if yes, in all output versions)

- consider http://psyx.org/hermes/doc.html for translations from LaTeX to
  MathML.

- finalize lib/Examples.g for builtin manual example tester and include and
  document it.

- improve explanations of encodings, maybe add example how to handle a
  latin-2 special character. How about handling UTF-8?

- allow the distribution of different output documents (html, text, pdf,...)
  into different directories (needs to change the handler for GAPDoc books).

- think about combining index entries, when they point to the same section
  (e.g., a function with several types of arguments, where the entries are
  only distinguished by the 'Label' attribute and are explained in the same
  man section).
