                       CHANGES

0.99999 -> 1.0

- Changed the status of the package from "deposited" to "accepted".

- Print statements in some functions are now substituted by Info statements,
  such that they can be switched of, or can be set to debug level
  (new Info classes: InfoGAPDoc, InfoXMLParser, InfoBibTools).

- Removed some pre-GAP 4.4 syntax.

- The default LaTeX markup for <A>, <Arg> is now by slanted typewriter
  font.

- The internal encoding for the parsed data is now UTF-8, this is also 
  recommended for input (all GAPDoc files are now in UTF-8 encoding).

- Introduced unicode characters and strings as GAP objects and de- and
  encoding of these from and to GAP strings in UTF-8 or ISO-8859 encodings.

- New element <Ignore Remark="...">. Can be used everywhere (e.g., for
  additional data like source code, or to comment non finished parts of
  the document).

- ParseTreeXMLString can use the improved information from ComposedXMLString
  to give better error messages in case of parsing errors. This uses the new
  function OriginalPositionComposedXML.

- ComposedXMLString can now return information about the original file and 
  line number of any text in the composed XML document.

- Improved the documentation which markup is allowed in attribute values
  (recursively substituted entities). Improved the code to handle all
  special XML or LaTeX characters in attribute values, they must be escaped
  by the converter programs for HTML and LaTeX output.
  
- Changed further details for handling special characters; e.g. in LaTeX we
  now try to use always the nicer characters for \{}~^ from the \texttt
  font.

0.9999 -> 0.99999

- Now MathSciNet often gives two numbers as MRNUMBER in BibTeX references.
  For links in HTML text we use now only the first 9 characters (MRxxxxxxx).
  (Thanks to Alan Cain.)

- HTML conversion: 
  - changed XHTML DOCTYPE to official URI of definition.
  - added 'lang="en"' and 'xml:lang="en"' attributes to the <html ... > tag.
  - fixed a problem with forward references. (Thanks to Marco Costantini.)

- PDF conversion:
  - using author and title in document for PDF meta-information.
  - attribute values with underscores were not correctly escaped, this is
    fixed and an example is added to the documentation, see
    ?GAPDoc Example: MyOperation (for bla)
  - now handling XML meta-characters '<>&' in attribute values.
  
- The XML Parser now prints the position of the start tag when it finds 
  a non-fitting end tag.

- Some minor documentation improvements.
