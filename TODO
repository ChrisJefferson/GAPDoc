           Some reminders for the authors

- Can TestManualExamples be changed such that only call of
  TestExamplesString is necessary. Current version doesn't work when
  the examples depend on each other, variables may be different on
  second call of TestExamplesString.

- allow the distribution of different output documents (html, text, pdf,...)
  into different directories (needs to change the handler for GAPDoc books).

- think about combining index entries, when they point to the same section
  (e.g., a function with several types of arguments, where the entries are
  only distinguished by the 'Label' attribute and are explained in the same
  man section).

- investigate using xelatex and direct unicode input for the LaTeX version.
